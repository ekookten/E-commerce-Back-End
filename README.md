Title:
The E-Commerce Back End API is a powerful solution designed to manage the backend operations of an online store. This API handles the critical functions of managing categories, products, and tags, making it an essential component for any e-commerce platform. By utilizing modern web technologies like Express.js and Sequelize, this API efficiently interacts with a PostgreSQL database, ensuring that data is handled securely and effectively. The design of this project follows best practices in software development, ensuring that the codebase is not only functional but also maintainable and scalable.

Description:
This project serves as the backend for an e-commerce site, providing all the necessary CRUD operations for managing products, categories, and tags. It uses Express.js to create a RESTful API and Sequelize as an ORM to manage database interactions with PostgreSQL. The API allows users to create, read, update, and delete entries in the database, making it a versatile tool for managing the various data needs of an online store. The project is structured in a way that promotes clean, organized, and efficient code, ensuring that it can be easily maintained and expanded upon as needed. By adhering to industry best practices, this API is built to be both reliable and easy to work with, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to manage e-commerce data.

How to Run:
To get started with the E-Commerce Back End API, you’ll first need to clone the repository to your local machine and install all the necessary dependencies. After setting up your environment variables with the appropriate database credentials, you’ll need to create the database using the provided schema. Once the database is set up, you can seed it with initial data, ensuring that the necessary tables and relationships are in place. Finally, you can start the server and begin interacting with the API. Testing the API can be done using tools like Insomnia or Postman, where you can send requests to the various endpoints and see the API in action. The process is straightforward, making it easy for developers to get the backend up and running quickly.
